  Description:
    Abstract: This report presents the results of the USGS Mineral Resources Program activity to compile a national-scale geologic map database at a nominal scale of 1:500,000, to support national and regional level projects, including mineral resource and geoenvironmental assessments. The only comprehensive sources for input into regional- and national-scale geologic maps are state geologic maps with scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000.  Digital versions of these state maps form the core of what is presented here.  Because no adequate geologic map exists for the state of Alaska, it is being compiled as regional blocks of 3 degree quadrangles that also form part of this national database. It is expected that this series will completed by approximately the end of 2007.  These maps and databases are being released in blocks of states or, in the case of Alaska, as compiled blocks of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles as chapters in this series.  For Alaska, formal maps as well as databases are being published here, whereas for the conterminous U.S. only state databases are presented, because published maps for most states already exist.  For Alaska these regional compilations will form the base for compiling a new geologic map of the state.  As documented in CONUS documentation, standards for the conterminous U.S. are somewhat different than those for Alaska and Hawaii.
    Purpose: A primary goal of this work is to develop geologic map datasets with standardized structure and attribution.  The database design and standards are documented in CONUS documentation of this report.  The intent is that contiguous databases can be merged seamlessly and without any additional effort.  In addition to a common database structure, the conterminous U.S. state databases (the contiguous 48 states) have been fitted to a set of standard state boundaries derived from the USGS Digial Line Graph 1:100,000 quadrangle boundaries (Johnson and Leveritch, 1998) so that, when states are merged, they match without slivers or overlap.  No attempt has been made to reconcile differences in mapping across state boundaries.
    Supplemental_Information:
      This database consists of five major Arc/Info GIS datasets for each state;
      - one: geologic map with formations,
      - two: faults (where present),
      - three: dikes (where present),
      - four: miscellaneous line features (where present),
      - five: miscellaneous point features (where present).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The purpose of this standardization is to allow all covers to be seamlessly joined without any additional effort to form regional or national level digital maps. Note that for Alaska, the state is being compiled as blocks of 1:250k quadrangles that will ultimately be used to compile a new state map.  Douglas Stoeser and Ric Wilson are co-coordinators for the overall State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) effort, with Stoeser coordinating work on the mainland states and Wilson coordinating work for Alaska and Hawaii.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        C.L. Dicken received the digital geology file from Karen Hostettler of the Virginia Department of Mines, Mineral and Energy on July 12, 2005 by ftp.

        The coverage was re-projected into the following:

        projection:		Lambert Conformal Conic
        units:			meters
        datum:			NAD27
        standard parallel 1: 	33 0 0.000
        standard parallel 2: 	45 0 0.000
        central meridian:	-100 0 0.000
        reference latitude:	0 0 0.000
        false easting:		0.00000
        false northing:		0.00000

        All attributes were deleted except geology.

        (Note:  Attributes associated with the generation of the coverages were not deleted.
        PAT - shape, area, perimeter, coverage#, and coverage-id
        AAT - shape, fnode#, tnode#, lnode#, rnode#, length, coverage#, and coverage-id)

        The values from geology where then calculated into a new field called orig_label.
      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The relevant state outline (arcs) was removed from the coverage and replaced with the arcs from the 1:100,000 Scale State Boundaries of the Conterminous United States.

        This allows for a seamless fit of each state to a standard state boundary base.
      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The following attributes were exported from Filemaker as a .dbf:
        orig_label, map_symbol2, unit_link, reference_id, unit_age, rocktype1, and rocktype2.

        orig_label  reflects the original map symbol used on the source map

        map_symbol2  reflects map-symbol1 with the addition of a province number (renamed sgmc_label in PAT)

        unit_link  is an auto generated field based on map-symbol2 and the state abbreviation (e.g. IN001) that produces a unique identifier for each map unit

        reference_id was populated with an alphanumeric code (e.g. US001) that designates the source used for the linework and other references used to describe the age or lithologies of the unit.  (renamed source in PAT).

        unit_age  was populated with general age assignment

        rocktype1  records dominant lithology (must be >50% of unit), using standardized data dictionary

        rocktype2  records second most dominant lithology, using standardized data dictionary



        The attributes were then converted using the following structure:

        item name:	orig_label
        width:		12
        output:		12
        type:		c

        item name:	sgmc_label
        width:		16
        output:		16
        type:		c

        item name:	unit_link
        width:		18
        output:		18
        type:		c

        item name:	source
        width:		6
        output:		8
        type:		c

        item name:	unit_age
        width:		60
        output:		60
        type:		c

        item name:	rocktype1
        width:		40
        output:		40
        type:		c

        item name:	rocktype2
        width:		40
        output:		40
        type:		c
      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Once the .dbf was in the correct format with standardized column widths and data structure, it was converted into a lookup table (.lut) in Arc/Info.  Then a joinitem was performed to join the look-up table to the polygon attribute table.  orig_label was used as the merge item.
      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Next, in preparing the uniform .aat file, the following items were added to the table:

        item name:  arc-code
        width:	3
        output:	3
        type:	i

        item name:  arc-para1
        width:	3
        output:	3
        type:	i

        item name:  arc-para2
        width:	3
        output:	3
        type:	i

        item name:  source
        width:	6
        output:	8
        type:	c

      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Arc-code was populated using the paper map source to tag the lines using the AAT line type data dictionary (see CONUS documentation in this report).

        Arc-para1 was populated when additional information was available such as identifying the upthrown side of a fault or direction of thrusting on a fault. (see CONUS documentation)

        Arc-para2 is a scratch field that is used mostly in Alaska.

        Source was populated with an alphanumeric code (e.g. US001) that designates the source used for the linework.

      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Once the .aat and the .pat were populated with the correct attributes, the coverage was exported as an .e00 file (VAgeol_lcc.e00).

        Then it was unprojected into geographic coordinates and exported again (VAgeol_dd.e00).
      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Separate faults were received from DMME and the fault coverage.  The arcs were attributed with arc-code = 30.  The file was projected into the Lambert projection and saved as VAfaults_lcc.  It was then exported as VAfaults_lcc.e00.
      Process_Date: 2005
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Finally, the geology lines and geology polygons were converted into shapefiles; in both geographic coordinates and in Lambert Conformal Conic projection.
