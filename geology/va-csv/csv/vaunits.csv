The Everona occurs dominantly as lenticular bodies immediately north west of or within the Mountain Run fault zone (Evans, 1984; Conley, 1989; Rossman, 1991). In most outcrops primary laminations are complexly folded due tostrain accommodation associated with the Mountain Run fault. Unit thickness and degree of lateral continuity are structurally controlled in many places. Mack (1965) reports thicknesses ranging from about 20 to 1100 feet. Jonas (1927) reports retrieving trilobite fragments from sandy beds adjacent to the Everona, but these were so poorlypreserved that E.O. Ulrich could not identify them, even with respect to genus. Recent attempts to extract conodonts from the Everona have so far proven fruitless.

Light- to medium-gray, fine- to medium grained, polydeformed and polymetamorphosed porphyroblastic aluminosilicate-mica schist, interlayered with medium-gray irregularly-layered garnetiferous biotite gneiss, migmatitic in part; calcsilicate granofels; amphibolite; rare white marble; and, coarse calc-quartzite lenses. Complex schistosity, multiple crenulation cleavages, and partly-retrograded, polymetamorphic aluminosilicateand garnet porphyroblasts are diagnostic of Fork Mountain schists. Primary sedimentary structures rarely are preserved. A spectacular polymictic breccia bed that can be traced along strike for several miles within the Fork Mountain near Stuart is a notable exception. Medium- to coarse-granular, blue quartz lenses, angular to rounded inclusions of boudinaged fine-grained, color-laminated, calc-silicate rock, and thick beds of coarse, clast-supported, epidotized lithic breccia are typical of the Fork Mountain biotite gneiss.Prograde regional metamorphic mineral assemblages: (1) quartz + muscovite + biotite + garnet + staurolite + magnetite- ilmenite + rutile; (2) quartz + muscovite + paragonite +plagioclase + garnet + staurolite + sillimanite + magnetite-ilmenite + rutile; (3) quartz + biotite + sillimanite + potassium feldspar + plagioclase + garnet + magnetite-ilmenite;(4) quartz + plagioclase + biotite + muscovite + sillimanite + garnet + tourmaline; (5) quartz + plagioclase + potassium feldspar + biotite + hornblende + epidote + ilmenite; (6) quartz + plagioclase + potassium feldspar + muscovite + biotite + sillimanite + magnetite-ilmenite + garnet + kyanite.

Contact metamorphic mineral assemblages: (1) andalusite + sillimanite + kyanite + corundum; (2) corundum + spinel + magnetite + kyanite. Geophysical signature: The Fork Mountain has a characteristic ""curly maple"" pattern on magnetic contour maps. This pattern is the result of isolated concentrations of highly magnetic minerals that produce rounded, high-intensity, positive and negative anomalies. The aluminosilicate-mica schist is the upper part of the Fork Mountain Formation and forms a series of northeastward-trending ridges along the northwest side of the Smith River allochthon. The garnetiferous biotite gneiss is at a lower structural level of the Fork Mountain Formation near Martinsville where lower strata have been intruded by the Martinsville igneous complex, and the remaining metasedimentary rocks contain extensive thermal meta mor phic zoneslocallized along the intrusive contacts (Conley and Henika, 1973). Biotite gneiss in the Fork Mountain Formation has been interpreted to be a highly metamorphosed diamictite(Rankin, 1975; Conley, 1985; and Pavlides, 1989). At the northeastern limit of the Fork Mountain outcrop belt, in Appomattox and Buckingham counties, the dominant lithologies are polydeformed yellowish-gray chloritoid-chlorite- muscovite quartzose phyllite and quartz-rich mica schist. Tightly-folded, transposed pinstriped segregation layering at a high angle to the penetrative schistosity defined by phyllosilicate minerals is characteristic; polycrystalline quartz-rich boudins are abundant. These rocks are lithologically indistinguishable from those along the highly-tectonized western margin of the metagraywacke, quartzose schist, and melange (CZpm) outcrop belt; current interpretation is that the Fork Mountain is correlative to some degree with CZpm.",VA003,mica schist,gneiss,quartzite; melange,VA001VA002 VA003

Breccia fragments range from 1 to 20 cm long, and form rough, knobby surfaces on weathered outcrops. Where present, this breccia occurs at or near the base of Catoctin metabasalt (CZc) on the southeast limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium; the unit is as much as 3000 feet thick. Furcron (1939) mapped both high- and low-titanium breccias as Warrenton agglomerate; R.L. Smith (personal communication in Espenshade, 1986) interpreted the breccias as subareal agglutinates. Kline and others (1990) presented evidence that the breccias are hyaloclastite pillow breccias, erupted in a subaqueous environment. Reed (1955) recognized a mappable stratigraphy within the Catoctin, and made the interpretation that the greenstones were metamorphosed tholeiitic flood basalts that originated in a ""nonorogenic"" setting. Rankin (1975) considered the Catoctin to have originated during continental volcanism associated with the opening of a proto-Atlantic Iapetus ocean in Latest Precambrian time, and included the Catoctin in the Crossnore volcanic-plutonic group. Badger and Sinha (1988) studied chemical stratigraphy within individual fl ows and dated Catoctin metabasalts at 570 ñ 36 Ma using Rb-Sr systematics on samples showing little evidence of elemental mobility during metamorphism. This date is consistent with radiometric age data from Catoctin metarhyolite, discussed above, and with the occurrence of Early Cambrian-age Rusophycus stratigraphically above the Catoctin near the base of the Chilhowee Group (Simpson and Sundberg, 1987). These constraints suggest that some portion of the Catoctin may be as young as Cambrian in age. Regional mapping suggests that metabasalts and amphibole gneisses within the Ashe (Zaa), Alligator Back (CZas), and Bassett Formations (CZba) are volcanogenic rocks that are correlative with the Catoctin in a lithostratigraphic sense and in terms of tectonic setting, but not necessarily in a strict time sense.

Regional mapping by Henika (1991) and Scheible (1975) indicates that rocks assigned to Alligator Back Formation by Rankin and others (1973) are continuous with the upper part of the Lynchburg Group in the type section along the James River at Lynchburg (Jonas, 1927) and that the Alligator Back consistently dips southeast beneath the overlying Candler Formation from the Virginia-North Carolina border to the James River at Lynchburg.

It has a discontinuous underlying border of precursory ophiolitic melange, the Yorkshire Formation. The allochthon consisting of the Piney Branch and Yorkshire was thrust upon the Peters Creek Schist, and with it form a composite allochthon that was emplaced on the Sykesville Formation perhaps by gravity sliding. It unconformably underlies the Popes Head Formation. Movement of the Piney Branch began in the Late Proterozoic after the metamorphism of the Peters Creek, and ended during the Taconic Orogeny.

VA002):Metagraywacke, quartzose schist, and melange. Metagraywackes are quartzose chlorite or biotite schists containing very fine to coarse granules of blue quartz; primary gradedlaminations have been transposed by shearing into elongate lozenges that give the rock a distinctive pin-striped appearance in weathered surfaces perpendicular to schistosity. Amylonitic fabric is superimposed in varying degrees, as are late-stage chevron-style folds. In Buckingham, Appomattox, and Campbell Counties, rocks in this unit are progressively more tectonized from east to west across the outcrop belt; in the western portion, the dominant lithology is a polydeformed, mylonitic mica schist with abundant quartz-rich boudins; transposed pinstriped lamination or segregation layering at a high angle to mylonitic schistosity is characteristic. Metagabbroic blocks ranging in size from 5 cm to 3 m across and larger have been identified at widely scattered locations throughout the outcrop belt. Mineralogy: quartz + albite + epidote + chlorite + muscovite + magnetite ñ chloritoid ñ calcite; biotite- and staurolite-bearing assemblages occur in Appomattox and Campbell Counties. Detrital minerals identifi ed in thin section include plagioclase, perthite, epidote, magnetite, tourmaline, and titanite. Lithic fragments include dacite tuff, gabbro, and monocrystalline quartz with zircon and biotite inclusions(Evans, 1984). The northern portion of the outcrop belt includes melange zone IV of the Mine Run complex of Pavlides (1989; 1990).In Albemarle and Fluvanna counties, CZpm includes the lower chlorite-muscovite unit of Smith and others (1964) and Hardware metagraywacke of Evans (1984). In Appomattox and Buckingham Counties, polydeformed quartzose mica schists in the western portion of the outcrop belt are lithologically indistinguishable from schists mapped as Fork Mountain Formation in structural blocks that occur to the west; these units are considered to be at least in part correlative.

Dominantly dark gray to grayish-black, lustrous, very-fine-grained, graphitic slate (northeastern sector); and, medium-grained, porphyroblastic garnetiferous biotite schist (southwestern sector). Discontinuous beds of quartzose muscovite schist, coarse grained to pebbly micaceous quartzite, and conglomeratic schist occur along the margins of the outcrop belt, stratigraphically at the base of the section. Interbeds of dacite metatuff occur in the western portion of the slate outcrop belt. Graded laminated metasiltstone and metasandstone are interbedded with slate in the central and eastern portions of the outcrop belt at the latitude of the James River (Evans and Marr, 1988); these rocks pass into porphyroblastic schists at higher metamorphic grades to the southwest. A distinctive garnet-amphibole-quartz interbed occurs within porphyroblastic schist south of the James River (volcanogenic marker?; Brown, 1969); north of the river, this passes down metamoprphic grade into what is described as an oolitic chlorite schist (Smith and others, 1964). Mineralogy: (slate) chlorite + mus co vite + plagioclase + quartz + magnetite ñ biotite ñ calcite ñ graphite ñ pyrite; (porphyroblastic schist) biotite + muscovite + garnet + quartz+ plagioclase + magnetite ñ kyanite ñ calcite; tourmaline and zircon are common accessories. Geophysical signature: The Arvonia is marked by positive magnetic and radiometric anomalies. Originally referred to as the slate in the Arvonia belt by Rogers (1884), the unit was named Arvonia slate by Stose and Stose (1948), and raised to formation status by Brown (1969). An Upper Ordovician age for the Arvonia has been established from fossils collected by Watson and Powell (1911), Stose and Stose (1948), Tillman (1970), and Kolata and Pavlides (1986). The Arvonia has long been considered unconformable on top of adjacent units. Micaceous quartzite, pebbly mus covite schist, and conglomeratic schist are common at the base of the section where that boundary is not faulted (Stose and Stose, 1948; Smith and others, 1964; Brown, 1969; Evans and Marr, 1988). The base of the Arvonia is exposed in an old railroad cut near Carysbrook, Fluvanna County (Smith and others, 1964); there, a micaceous quartzite containing quartz pebbles rests on granite of the Carysbrook pluton. The Stoses (1948) considered the Arvonia a sequence deposited on a post-Taconic-orogeny regional unconformity, and folded and metamorphosed during subsequent orogenies; that interpretation is consistent with geologic constraints as we know them today. The Arvonia is correlated with the Quantico Formation. History of the Arvonia district slate industry is discussed by Brown (1969) and Evans and Marr (1988).",VA003,slate,schist,,VA001 VA002VA003

Mineral assemblages are those found in Arvonia slates and porphyroblastic schists. Conglomeratic schist occurs along the western margin of the principal Buffards outcrop belt, and as discontinuous lenses too small to show at 1:500,000 scale, at or near the western margin (stratigraphic base) of the Arvonia slate outcrop belt (Oa) (Evans and Marr, 1988). Although Brown (1969) in defining the Buffards Formation considered these rocks to be a pyroclastic deposit stratigraphically above the Arvonia Formation, other workers have interpreted Buffards rocks to be at a lower stratigraphic position relative to the Arvonia. Conley and Marr (1980) considered the Buffards part of the Chopawamsic Formation, unconformablybelow the Arvonia. Stose and Stose (1948) and Evans and Marr (1988) considered the Buffards to be stratigraphically at or near the base of the Arvonia Formation. Buffards conglomeratic schists contain tuffaceous and ferruginous-quartzite clasts similar to rocks that occur in the Chopawamsic Formation; this is consistent with the Buffards being derived in part from, and deposited unconformably on, the Chopawamsic.

VA002):Columbia pluton. Light-gray, medium- to coarse grained, foliated. Includes biotite-muscovite granite, granodiorite, tonalite, and granitic pegmatite; contains xenoliths of biotite gneiss, amphibolite, and felsic metavolcanic rocks. Mineralogy: plagioclase + quartz + microcline; common accessories include biotite, muscovite, epidote, zircon, apatite, garnet, magnetite, and pyrite (Bourland and Glover, 1979). Geophysical signature: diffuse magnetic lows and radiometric highs. The pluton was originally named Columbia Granite by Jonas (1928); this name was objected to by later workers because of the relatively small percentage of true granite present. The pluton includes the southeastern portion of the granodiorite unit of Smith and others (1964). Granitic rocks in the Carysbrook area of Fluvanna County are here considered part of a separate Carysbrook pluton, following the usage of Stose and Stose (1948). The Columbia includes, in part, the Hatcher complex of Brown (1969). Bourland and Glover (1979) refer to the pluton as the Columbia metagranite. Given the heterogeneous nature of the pluton, multiple intrusive phases are likely present.	 Tonalite in the eastern part of the pluton has yielded ages of 590+/-80 Ma, (Rb-Sr whole-rock; Fullagar, 1971). Mose andNagel (1982) report a Rb-Sr whole-rock age for the Columbia of 454ñ9 Ma. Because samples for this age are described as coming from the western portion of the Columbia, it is possible that the rocks dated were taken from what is herein mapped as the Carysbrook pluton (grc).",VA003,granite,,,VA001 VA002VA003

The Quantico unconformably overlies older units in the northeastern Pied mont, and is correlated with the Arvonia Formation to the southwest.	",VA003,slate,schist,,VA001VA002VA003

The formation grades from dolomite with minor limestone and a basal sandstone in southwestern Lee County (Cayuga Dolomite of Miller and Fuller, 1954) to limestone with an underlying or interbedded dolomite with sandstone partings, and a basal sandstone to the northeast and east (Harris and Miller, 1958; Miller and Roen, 1971). The Hancock Formation ranges from 75 to 225 feet in thickness and correlates with the Tonoloway Limestone. Rose Hill Formation . Refer to description under Skrt.Clinch Formation (Safford, 1856). Quartzarenite and shale. Quartzarenite, very-light gray, olive-gray, and brownish- gray with local grayish-red beds, very-fine-grained tovery-coarse-grained with local conglomeratic zones, thin- to thick-bedded with thin, green ish-gray and dark-gray shale beds and partings in upper part. Shale, light-olive-gray togray ish-green; with thin, very fine- to fine-grained sandstone interbeds in the lower one-third to one-quarter of the unit. Erosional unconformity at base of unit identified in northern Lee County (Mill er and Roen, 1973). The Clinch Formation ranges from 220 to 330 feet in thickness.The Division of Mineral Resources uses the name Clinch Formation for exposures in Lee, Wise, and Scott counties where the lower Silurian rocks include the lower Hagan ShaleMember and the upper Poor Valley Ridge Sand stone Member. The name Tuscarora Formation is used for the lower Silurianquartzitic sandstone unit in all areas northward in the Valley and Ridge of Virginia, including the Clinch Mountain area where the name Clinch Formation was first used, because of similarity between the Tuscarora and the rocks on Clinch Mountain. In the past many geologists used the name Clinch Sandstone in the southern part of the Valley and Ridge of Virginia and the name Tuscarora Formation in the northern part of the Valley and Ridge of Virginia (Butts, 1940) for essentially the same group of quartzitic sandstones. Dennison and Boucot (1974) and Mill er (1976) described the facies change of the lower Silurian Clinch Sandstone of Southwest Virginia from quartzitic sandstones in the Clinch Mountain belt in Scott and Wise Counties to sandstones and shales in the Lee, southwestern Wise, and western Scott counties area.",VA003,shale,siltstone,sandstone; dolostone (dolomite); limestone; conglomerate,VA001VA002VA003

The Keefer is equivalent to the upper portion of the Massanutten Sandstone. (The Keefer Sandstone, as usedin this report, includes all of the quartzarenites with minor Skolithus-bearing red sand stone and minor calcite cemented quartzarenite in the interval above the Rose Hill Formation and below the Tonoloway Limestone in Botetourt, Rockbridge, andAugusta counties between Eagle Rock and Augusta Springs (Lampiris, 1976). Rose Hill Formation (Swartz, 1923). Sandstone, dark grayish-red, fine- to coarse-grained, poorly-sorted, argillaceous; hematite cemented, quartz sandstone interbedded with red or yellowish-green clay shale and greenish-gray, fine-grained sandstone. It is largely siltstone and shale with minor sandstone and thin limonitic iron ore beds in SouthwestVirginia. Conformable with the underlying Tuscarora Formation, the Rose Hill Formation ranges up to 500 feet in thickness in northern and western Virginia but pinches-outin southwest ern Botetourt and Roanoke counties where the Keefer and Tuscarora For ma tions merge. It is present with other Silurian rocks everywhere except in the Massanutten Mountains or where an unconformity exists in exposures eastof Walker Mountain.Tuscarora Formation (Darton and Taff, 1896). Quartzite, quartzarenite, and minor shale. Quartzite, light-gray with few nearly white, porcelaneous beds, fine- to medium-grained,with quartz-pebble conglomerate locally near base, quartz cemented, thick-bedded, and cross-bedded, resistant, cliff- and ledge-former, generally not more than 75 feet thick, comprises entire unit in many areas or is upper member where unconformably overlying a lower quartzarenite and shale member.

Mineralogy: hornblende + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + magnetite + biotite ñ scapolite ñ garnet ñ quartz ñ epidote. Geophysical signature: narrow, strike-elongate, positive magnetic anomaly. Lenses and layers of amphibolite and amphibole gneiss are interlayered with porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss (Ymd).

Amphibolite and interlayered biotite gneiss adjacent to the State Farm gneiss were named the Sabot amphibolite by Poland (1976), who characterized the formation as a tabular sheet 0.7 to 1.0 km thick. He and Goodwin (1970) interpreted these amphibolites as metamorphosed mafic volcanic or pyroclastic rocks.

Metamorphosed anorthosite includes non-foliated extremely coarse-grained and foliated, recrystallized coarse-grained textural varieties. Primary mineralogy consists of antiperthitic plagioclase, clinopyroxene, apatite, and ilmenite. Amphibole, biotite, quartz, garnet, rutile, and titanite occur as later metamorphic minerals (Farrar, 1984). Xenoliths in the anorthosite could have been derived from the adjacent amphibolite and amphibole gneiss (Ya), porphyroblastic garnet-biotite gneiss (Ymd), and State Farm gneiss (Ysf).	 Geophysical signature: positive radiometric and negative magnetic anomalies. Close geochemical similarities between the Montpelier and the Grenville-age Roseland anorthosite of the central Blue Ridge (Yra) have led to the hypothesis, as yet untested, that the Montpelier is Grenville in age (Clement and Bice, 1982; Farrar, 1984).

Mesocratic, medium- to coarse-grained, biotite-rich quartzofeldspathic gneiss con tains prominent subhedral to euhedral monocrystalline feldspar augen. The ratio plagioclase: potassium feldspar may be as high as 10:1; color index ranges from 30 to 50. Apatite, epidote, muscovite, ilmenite, and titanite are ubiquitous accessories. Plagioclase contains abundant prismatic epidote and white mica; ilmenite is rimmed with masses of anhedral titanite; subhedral hornblende and subhedral to euhedral almandine-grossular garnet occur locally. In the vicinity of adjacent charnockite, anhedral actinolitic amphibole pseudomorphs after pyroxene or rims thoroughly uralitized relict pyroxene. Rock fabric is gradational from granofels to mylonite gneiss. Geophysical signature: negative magnetic signature relative to adjacent charnockite. In northern Virginia, this unit strongly resembles prophyroblastic granite gneiss (Ybp); however, the augen in Ybp are more commonly polycrystalline aggregates rather than single-crystal porphyroblasts. This unit is widespread in the central and southeastern Blue Ridge, encompassing a number of lithologically similar metaplutonic entities: the ""biotitic facies""of the Roses Mill and Turkey Mountain ferrodiorites of Herzand Force (1987), the Archer Mountain quartz monzonite of Bartholomew and others (1981), biotite granofels and augen gneiss of Evans (1984, 1991), biotite augen gneiss of Conley (1989), and augen-bearing gneiss of Lukert and Halladay (1980), and Lukert and Nuckols (1976). Historically, most workers have interpreted these rocks as Grenville-age plutons in which the present-day biotite-rich mineral assemblage is a primary igneous assemblage that crystallized from a melt (for example, Bartholomew and others, 1981). Herz and Force (1987) and Evans (1991) presented evidence that these biotite gneisses were derived from charnockite plutons by retrograde hydration reactions.	Pettingill and others (1984) reported ages of 1009ñ26 Ma (Rb-Sr whole-rock) and 1004ñ36 Ma (Sm-Nd whole-rock) for ferrodiorite to quartzmonzonite in the Roseland district.

Porphyroblasts of potassium feldspar range from 1 to 10 cm while plagioclase and quartz are generally 2 cm or less in maximum dimension. Mafic minerals, including almandine, biotite, chlorite, hornblende,and opaque minerals, are, in places, concentrated in layers. Almandine (up to 1 cm in diameter) makes up as much as 3 percent of the mode, while hornblende, commonly 0.5 to 0.75 cm in length, constitutes less than 1 percent. The rock breaks along cleavage surfaces that are commonly rich in chlorite, giving the whole rock a light green color. A U-Pb zircon age from this rock is 1144ñ2 Ma; two different populations of monazite give ages of 1106ñ1 Ma and 1063ñ1 Ma, respectively (Aleinikoff and others, 1993).

This unit underlies a wide area that surrounds the StateFarm antiform (Poland, 1976; Reilly, 1980; Farrar, 1984) and two subsidiary antiforms to the northeast; the unit includes the Maidens gneiss and portions of the Sabot amphibolite of Poland (1976), the eastern gneiss complex and Boscobel granodiorite gneiss of Bobyarchick (1976), and the Po River Metamorphic Suite of Pavlides (1980).Poland (1976) and Reilly (1980) proposed that the Maidens gneiss and Sabot amphibolite were a Late Precambrian- to Early Paleozoic-age volcanic-sedimentary cover sequence unconformably overlying the State Farm gneiss.

Moderate-olive-brown to dusky yellowish- green to black-and-white-banded, medium- to fine-grained biotite-hornblende gneiss, with interlayers of light gray, fine-grained quartz-feldspar gneiss, amphibolite, and mica schist. Felsitic crystal tuff breccia, feldspathic conglomerate, and mafic and felsic dikes and sills are recognized within the Moneta, especially along the James River west of Lynchburg. Wang and Glover (1991) recognized two kinds of mafic metavolcanic rocks in this unit, lavas and tuffs.

VA002):Diana Mills complex (Brown, 1969). Principally hornblende metadiorite and hornblende-quartz metadiorite; includes hornblendite, amphibolite, metaperidotite, orbicular serpentinite, pegmatite, and aplite. Metamorphosed hornblende diorite and hornblende-quartz diorite are dark-grayish-green, medium-grained porphyritic, and massive to crudely-foliated. Phenocrysts are 1 to 10 mm anhedral to subhedral plagioclase of intermediate composition; matrix minerals include hornblende and plagioclase, with variable amounts of biotite and quartz. Accessory minerals include: apatite, zircon, muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite, and pyrrhotite. Epidote, chlorite, and titanite are common secondary minerals. Hornblendites are dark-green, medium- to coarse-grained rocks consisting dominantly of blocky euhedral to subhedral hornblende, with minor interstitial highly altered feldspar, and apatite. Amphibolite and metaperidotite are dark-green coarse grained rocks composed of anhedral pale-green uralitic hornblende which in places contains relict clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, and rounded blebs of serpentine with cores of acicular tremolite, apparently after olivine. Orbicular serpentinite is dark-gray serpentinite composed of variable amounts of talc, amphibole, and chlorite, with fragmentary remnant pyroxene; the rock contains rounedorbicules from about 2 to 20 cm in diameter. These are composed predominantly of fibrous antigorite, oriented in concentric bands around the periphery, and contain cracksfilled with magnetite, chlorite, and talc. Pegmatite and aplite are composed of plagioclase, epidote, clinozoisite, muscovite, and quartz; hornblende megacrysts are present in some pegmatite. The complex is generally concordant with the foliation in the enclosing metagraywacke (Czpm), which shows enlarged micas and mica porphryoblasts adjacent to the contact. Structural setting and rock assemblage are suggestive of a layered intrusive sill (Brown, 1969).

Mineralogy: hornblende + plagioclase (intermediate composition); accessory minerals include apatite, titanite, zircon, garnet, pyrite, and magnetite. Augite, diopside, quartz, and potassium feldspar are locally present. Hornblende is largely replaced by chlorite or biotite; plagioclase contains abundant epidote inclusions. Late biotite porphyroblasts are common; these are commonly hydrated to form vermiculite. Rossman (1991) interprets the Green Springs to be a flattopped intrusive body with its upper surface approximately coincident with the present land surface. He notes that the pluton contains metasedimentary xenoliths that resemble the enclosing metagraywacke, and has a thermal aureole that is manifested by garnet and biotite porphryoblasts in the surrounding country rocks. Conley and Johnson (1975) concluded that the pluton was rootless at depth on the basis of a gravity study.

VA002):Swift Run Formation (Jonas and Stose, 1939; King, 1950; Gathright, 1976). Heterogeneous assemblage includes: pebbly to cobbly quartzite and feldspathic metaconglomerate; gray, grayish-pink, or grayish-green, feldspathic quartzite and metasandstone, locally crossbedded; greenish-gray, silvery quartz-sericite-chlorite sandy schist; and, greenish-gray to grayish-red-purple chlorite-sericite tuffaceous phyllite andslate. In Loudoun County, contains pinkish-gray and yellowish-gray to light brownish-gray, fine-grained dolomitic marble (Southworth, 1991). Individual lithologies are laterally discontinuous; formation ranges up to 350 feet in total thickness, but is locally very thin or absent (Gathright, 1976). The Swift Run was originally defined on the northwest limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium (Stose and Stose, 1946), where the unit rests unconformably on Grenville-age rocks, and is overlain conformably by the Catoctin Formation; the upper contact is mapped at the bottom of the lowest massivemetabasalt. In places Swift Run lithologies are interbedded with Catoctin metabasalts, and the contact between the two units is gradational (Gathright, 1976). Swift Run metasedimentary rocks on the northwest limb have been interpreted as deposited in alluvial fan, floodplain, and lacustrine environments (Schwab, 1986); these are interbedded with metamorphosed tuffaceous and volcanoclastic units (Gathright, 1976;Bartholomew, 1977). Although the Swift Run has been interpreted as a thin western equivalent of the Lynchburg Group in the southeastern Blue Ridge (Stose and Stose, 1946; Brown, 1970), some workers have correlated the Swift Run with discontinuous lenses of feldspathic sandstone interbedded with felsic metatuff that occur immediately below the Catoctin on the southeast limb of the anticlinorium (Nelson, 1962; Conley, 1978; 1989; Wehr, 1985). On the Geologic Map of Virginia (1993), the Swift Run is terminated along an east-west-trending normal fault just west of Leesburg, and is not mapped farther southwest on the southeast limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium.",VA003,phyllite,sandstone,meta-conglomerate; schist; quartzite; slate,VA001VA003
VA,Zvi,Zvi,Zvi;0,VAZvi;0,0,,Virgilina Greenstone,Proterozoic Z,Virgilina Greenstone - Greenstone metabasalt.,,"Carolina Slate BeltFrom expanded explanation (ref. VA002):Virgilina greenstone (Laney, 1917). Grayish-green, fine- to coarse-grained basaltic tuff, metavolcanic breccia, and porphyritic to amygdaloidal greenstone, with minor interlayered metasedimentary rocks. Hydrothermally mineralized zones occur within the greenstones; these contain bornite, chalcocite, and chalcopyrite, and have been mined for copper. Mineralogy: plagioclase + hornblende + chlorite + epidote + calcite + apatite + quartz + opaque minerals. Geophysical signature: linear positive magnetic anomaly. Watson (1911) used the term Virgilina Group for a wide belt of rocks in the vicinity of Virgilina, Virginia. Mafic metavolcanic rocks in this sequence were named Virgilina greenstone, and felsic metavolcanic rocks and associated metasedimentary rocks were named Aaron slate by Laney (1917). Kreisa (1980) refined Laney's stratigraphy in defining the Aaron Formation as containing upper and lower members equivalent to Laney's Aaron slate, and a middle member equivalent to the Virgilina greenstone. The stratigraphy was further modified by Harris and Glover (1985), who combined the middle and upper members of Kreisa's Aaron Formation to make the Virgilina Formation. Virgilina greenstone is herein used in the sense of Laney (1917), but is equivalent to the middle member of the Aaron Formation of Kreisa (1980), and the lower portion of the Virgilina Formation of Harris and Glover (1985) (Figure 2).",VA003,greenstone,,,VA001VA002VA003
