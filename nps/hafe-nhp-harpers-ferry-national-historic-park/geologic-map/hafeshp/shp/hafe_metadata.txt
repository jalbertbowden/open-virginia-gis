  Description:
    Abstract: The Digital Geologic Map of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park and Vicinity, Maryland and West Virginia is composed of GIS data layers complete with ArcMap 9.3 layer (.LYR) files, two ancillary GIS tables, a Map PDF document with ancillary map text, figures and tables, a FGDC metadata record and a 9.3 ArcMap (.MXD) Document that displays the digital map in 9.3 ArcGIS.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Source geologic maps and data used to complete this GRI digital dataset were provided by the following: U.S. Geological Survey and Maryland Geological Survey.  Detailed information concerning the sources used and their contribution the GRI product are listed in the Source Citation sections(s) of this metadata record (hafe_metadata.txt; available at http://nrdata.nps.gov/hafe/nrdata/geology/gis/hafe_metadata.xml).  All GIS and ancillary tables were produced as per the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The GIS data is available as a 9.3 personal geodatabase (hafe_geology.mdb), and as shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table files.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 18N.  The data is within the area of interest of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, as well as Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.
    Purpose: The data are intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park.
    Supplemental_Information: The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Harpers Ferry National Historical Park and Vicinity, Maryland and West Virginia include: HAFEGLG (Geologic Units), HAFEGLGA (Geologic Contacts), HAFESUR (Surficial Units), HAFESURA (Surficial Contacts) and HAFEFLT (Faults).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (HAFEUNIT) Table, the Source Map Information (HAFEMAP) Table and the Map PDF Document (hafe_geology.pdf).  Refer to the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed data layer (feature class) and table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and implemented topology rules and relationship classes.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Feature and table attribution was derived and checked with the source map(s).  Attribution was checked (QCd) for errors.  Users of this data are advised to FULLY and CAREFULLY READ the "DISTRIBUTION LIABILITY" section of this metadata before using the data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: GIS data in 9.3 personal geodatabase (.MDB), and shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table file formats.
  Completeness_Report: All data is considered complete to the extent of the source map(s).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Data, produced from digital source data and digitized from a georeferenced source map .TIF image(s) (300dpi), is assumed to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  The PRECISION of any Shapefile (.SHP) files is DOUBLE.  Coordinate tics on the georeferenced (registered and rectified) source map image(s) were checked against control points that had the exact specified coordinates of the tic.  The direct distance between the image tic and its control point were measured.  All measured distances were less than 50% of the required distance to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (1/50th of an inch for maps at 1:20,000 scale and smaller).  Features were checked (QCd) after digitizing for positional accuracy errors using the georeferenced source map image.

      Source_Contribution: Geologic features were derived from source digital data. In addition, geologic features not present with the digital data were  digitized using a .TIF image of the source map that was scanned at 300dpi and georeferenced in NAD83 UTM.  The source map scan was also used to attribute features, as well as to check (QC) line quality, both positionally and spatially, and feature attribution.  Ancillary source map text, including unit descriptions, and graphics, if present, were captured, formatted and added to the map-related pdf file.  See the Process Step section for additional information.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 1.) Geologic features were captured from an inherited .e00 file, co_beds.e00, and digitized from a georeferenced image if not present in the source digital data.  Features were passed to their data model layer, then 'cropped' to the extent of the battlefield's present USGS 7.5’ quadrangles of interest, Williamsport, Keedysville and Shepherdstown.  A .pdf file of the published USGS source map was used to check attribution, as per the NPS GIS-Geology Coverage/Shapefile Data Model, and to check the positional and attribute accuracy of the data.  Features were exported from each data layer coverage to shapefile (.SHP) format.  Tables were exported from INFO tables to DBASEIV (.DBF) file formats.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 1.) GIS data in coverage format in the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Coverage/Shapefile Data Model was migrated to a 9.3 personal geodatabase consisting of "empty" NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1 schema. 2.) Data model topology was then added and validated, and any topological errors corrected.  If applicable, additional attribute fields were populated from already existing attribution or by using the source map. 3.) GIS feature classes were then exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (.SHP) format, and GIS tables exported from the geodatabase to DBASEIV (.DBF) format.  4.) The map-related PDF document was produced from textual information and figures present on the source maps.  This information was initially captured in a GRI formatted Windows Help (.HLP) file.  This file was imported into a template Help & Manual (.HMX) file and reformatted and edited, then compiled to produce the .PDF map document.  Additional information, if available from existing or new source maps, was then added.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the document was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.
