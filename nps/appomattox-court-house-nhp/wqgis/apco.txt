        trails and other layers as available and appropriate, compiled for 
        the purpose of displaying the locations of point-based hydrologic 
        features (water quality monitoring stations, stream gages, industrial
        discharges, drinking intakes, and water impoundments) proximate to 
        national park units.  The data are intended to be used as a set to 
        to ensure spatial alignment.  The accompanying Microsoft Excel file,

  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set contains small-scale base GIS data layers compiled by the 
      National Park Service Servicewide Inventory and Monitoring Program and 
      Water Resources Division for use in a Baseline Water Quality Data 
      Inventory and Analysis Report that was prepared for the park.  The report 
      presents the results of surface water quality data retrievals for the park 
      from six of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 
      national databases: (1) Storage and Retrieval (STORET) water quality 
      database management system; (2) River Reach File (RF3) Hydrography; (3) 
      Industrial Facilities Discharges; (4) Drinking Water Supplies; (5) Water 
      Gages; and (6) Water Impoundments.  The small-scale GIS data layers were 
      used to prepare the maps included in the report that depict the locations 
      of water quality monitoring stations, industrial discharges, drinking 
      intakes, water gages, and water impoundments.  The data layers included in 
      the maps (and this dataset) vary depending on availability, but generally 
      include roads, hydrography, political boundaries, USGS 7.5' minute 
      quadrangle outlines, hydrologic units, trails, and others as appropriate.  
      The scales of each layer vary depending on data source but are 
      generally 1:100,000.
    Purpose:
      The small-scale GIS data layers were used to prepare maps included in a 
      Baseline Water Quality Data Inventory and Analysis Report for the park.  
      The maps depict the locations of water quality monitoring stations, 
      industrial discharges, drinking intakes, water gages, and water 
      impoundments.

    These data are small-scale (generally 1:100,000 or 
    smaller).  They are intended to be used as a set.  The 
    data are not intended to be used with other data sets, 
    particularly larger-scale data, as they may not align 
    spatially.

DATA_QUALITY_INFORMATION
     
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      These data were compiled from several currently available data sources.  
      Typically, 1:100,000 Census Bureau 1992 TIGER line files, USGS 1:24,000 
      analog quadrangles and USGS 1:100,000 analog quadrangles were used for base 
      layer data development.  In addition, six of the United States Environmental 
      Protection Agency's (EPA) databases: (1) Storage and Retrieval (STORET) water 
      quality database management system; (2) River Reach File (RF3) Hydrography; 
      (3)Industrial Facilities Discharges; (4) Drinking Water Supplies; (5) Water Gages; 
      and (6) Water Impoundments were used for data development.  The accompanying 
      Microsoft Excel file, sources.xls, lists the data sources for each data layer.  
      Therefore, the attribute accuracy meets the standards developed for each source 
      data type. 
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    ArcView shapefiles were converted from Atlas*GIS.  The ESRI 
    Avenue script EXPCLEAN.AVE was used to ensure logical consistency 
    for each shapefile.
  Completeness_Report:
    Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and environs water resources.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        These data were compiled from several currently available data sources.  Typically, 
        1:100,000 Census Bureau 1992 TIGER line files, USGS 1:24,000 analog quadrangles and 
        USGS 1:100,000 analog quadrangles were used for base layer data development.  In 
        addition, six of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) databases: 
        (1) Storage and Retrieval (STORET) water quality database management system; (2) River 
        Reach File (RF3) Hydrography; (3)Industrial Facilities Discharges; (4) Drinking Water 
        Supplies; (5) Water Gages; and (6) Water Impoundments were used for data development.  
        The accompanying Microsoft Excel file, sources.xls, lists the data sources for each 
        data layer.  Therefore, the horizontal positional accuracy meets the standards 
        developed for each source data type.
