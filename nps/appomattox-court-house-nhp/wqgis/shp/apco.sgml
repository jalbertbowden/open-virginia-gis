The data are comprised of small-scale base GIS
data layers, including roads, hydrography, political boundaries,
trails and other layers as available and appropriate, compiled for
the purpose of displaying the locations of point-based hydrologic
features (water quality monitoring stations, stream gages, industrial
discharges, drinking intakes, and water impoundments) proximate to
national park units.  The data are intended to be used as a set to
to ensure spatial alignment.  The accompanying Microsoft Excel file,
sources.xls, lists the data sources for each data layer.

<abstract>
This data set contains small-scale base GIS data layers compiled by the
National Park Service Servicewide Inventory and Monitoring Program and
Water Resources Division for use in a Baseline Water Quality Data
Inventory and Analysis Report that was prepared for the park.  The report
presents the results of surface water quality data retrievals for the park
from six of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
national databases: (1) Storage and Retrieval (STORET) water quality
database management system; (2) River Reach File (RF3) Hydrography; (3)
Industrial Facilities Discharges; (4) Drinking Water Supplies; (5) Water
Gages; and (6) Water Impoundments.  The small-scale GIS data layers were
used to prepare the maps included in the report that depict the locations
of water quality monitoring stations, industrial discharges, drinking
intakes, water gages, and water impoundments.  The data layers included in
the maps (and this dataset) vary depending on availability, but generally
include roads, hydrography, political boundaries, USGS 7.5' minute
quadrangle outlines, hydrologic units, trails, and others as appropriate.
The scales of each layer vary depending on data source but are
generally 1:100,000.
</abstract>
<purpose>
The small-scale GIS data layers were used to prepare maps included in a
Baseline Water Quality Data Inventory and Analysis Report for the park.
The maps depict the locations of water quality monitoring stations,
industrial discharges, drinking intakes, water gages, and water
impoundments.

These data are small-scale (generally 1:100,000 or
smaller).  They are intended to be used as a set.  The
data are not intended to be used with other data sets,
particularly larger-scale data, as they may not align
spatially.

These data were compiled from several currently available data sources.
Typically, 1:100,000 Census Bureau 1992 TIGER line files, USGS 1:24,000
analog quadrangles and USGS 1:100,000 analog quadrangles were used for base
layer data development.  In addition, six of the United States Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) databases: (1) Storage and Retrieval (STORET) water
quality database management system; (2) River Reach File (RF3) Hydrography;
(3)Industrial Facilities Discharges; (4) Drinking Water Supplies; (5) Water Gages;
and (6) Water Impoundments were used for data development.  The accompanying
Microsoft Excel file, sources.xls, lists the data sources for each data layer.
Therefore, the attribute accuracy meets the standards developed for each source
data type.

ArcView shapefiles were converted from Atlas*GIS.  The ESRI

for each shapefile.
